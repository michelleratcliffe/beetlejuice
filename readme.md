<h3>Reflections</h3>

<p>We built the most of the website during class so had fun rebuilding it a few times to sink it into memory esp all the server/client stuff</p>
<p>Then once everything was working and I had a Harry Potter Quotes site, I changed my mind and decided to include all of Wizard kind.</p>
<p>On Friday we worked on the stretch goals together, John would try tackle one of them in a certain way and I would try the other way until we got it working then chose the one we liked the best and then used that. I added some validation as well, didnt add anything complex as it doesnt need it since its just quotes</p>
<p>Then changed my mind again after watching Beetlejuice on Saturday and changed it yet again.</p>
<p>The weekend I made it pretty and added sound</p>
<p>Sunday night I helped others deploy theirs and get them from failing to working then had so many issues with mine, went to bed eventually as I was too tired to think and this morning I realised I never build my dist folder... so got it working then realised I forgot to removed my readme from the .gitignore since it broke my last project so quickly added this and reanabled the sound and media queries that I had on the side as the sound kept driving my husband nuts while working on it...</p>
